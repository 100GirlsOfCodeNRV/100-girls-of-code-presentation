						<h2>The Major Divide</h2>
						<p>
							According to a Google doc that collects data on the number of women in tech companies, an average of 15.73% of tech jobs are held by women.
							Current at Apple only 20% of their employees are female, Google lags behind them with only 17%.
							In 1985, 37% of Computer Science Degrees were given to women, that number in 2008 was down to 18%.
							These numbers seem to be pretty steadily decreasing through the years, but this is especailly alarming since computer science degrees have gone up in numbers.
							The number of new undergraduate students in universities increased by 29% form 2012 to 2013, before that (2010-11) it grew 23%.
							The main issue with these numbers is that none of them are truely accurate. The data for this is hidden by the government and a lot of companies are worried about the PR implications.

							<h2>So why is this happening?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>A lot of girls don't know exactly what computer science is</li>
								<li>Girls don't want to feel alone in college, because none of their friends want to be an "engineer". Ultamitly a fear of not fitting in.</li>
								<li>It seems "too hard", when really computer science is a lot of fun.</li>
								<li>There are very few female role models in computer science.</li>
							</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>How can we fix this?</h2>
						<p>First and foremost we have to be Role-Models for our girls and reach out locally to let them know that we are out there.
							By participating in programs like 100 Girls of Code, Girls who Code, Girls Code DC, etc. we have a change to show girls between the ages of 12 and 17 that coding is tons of fun, and isn't boring.
							Showing girls that there are female role models out there that they can talk to is also a very important aspect of getting more female interest in Computer Science. There is a great project called Women of Silicon Valley, the interviews women in tech jobs in Silicon Valley and posts them along with their photos.
							So overall, a first step is awareness and "show and tell".

						<h2>100 Girls of Code - Our choice</h2>
						<p>This is program designed to get girls interested in Computer Science by providing them with exciting workshops run by women.
						These workshops not only introduce girls to code and show them exactly what a software engineer does everyday, but also gives them a real-world role model to ask questions to and get valuable information from.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>100 Girls of Code is a program of TN Code Academy and the Upper Cumberland Entrepreneurial Foundation, a public 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
							We have been in discussions with them over the last month, and have started our very own New River Valley Chapter.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This program provides:
							<ul>
								<li>Materials for the one-day workshop</li>
								<li>Teacher Training</li>
								<li>Promotional Assistance</li>
								<li>Technical and Education Support</li>
								<li>Participant Eligibility for Scholarships</li>
								<li>And more...</li>
							</ul>

			<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
			<p>There are several ways to sponsor a chapter in the area. Currently there is a #ONEofthe100 program that is trying to get companies to donate $100 per month for 12 months in order to help pay for these workshops.
				You can find out more about the different levels of contribution on <a href="http://100girlsofcode.com/sponsor.html">100girlsofcode.com/sponsor</a>.
			</p>

		<section>
			<p>Modea has graciously offered the office as well as a Bronze donation to help us get started for one workshop, but if we're going to get around the whole NRV we need everyone's help.</p>

						<h2>Benefits</h2>
						<p>This program will benefit the community as well as Modea.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Benefits for the community</h2>
						<p>The program not only introduces girls to the world of computer science, but we feel that it helps girls gain confidence in saying "Hey you can make a difference and you can have fun doing it."</p>
						<p>This also encourgages the community to see Modea as a source of education and caring individuals.</p>
						<p>The local universities will get an oppertunity to get their CS and Design girls involved in some volunteer work that means something to them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Benefits for Modea</h2>
						<p>Modea will be seen in a new light by the media by getting involved in a nationwide issue that helps our futures.</p>
						<p>This will also get us into schools and help us recruit more talent as these girls get into universities.</p>
						<p>The current Developers will be challenged as teaching helps you see problems in a new light. This will also challenge designers who want to learn to code by giving them the oppertunity to gain some training.</p>
						<p>We also feel that collaboration in this program will bleed into the work environment.</p>
