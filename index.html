						<h2>Stats first!</h2>
						<p>
							Between 15-17% of Software Engineering jobs are held by women. It is also projected that software engineering jobs will grow by 22%. It is also shown that 74% of girls are interested in STEM degrees, but only 3% actually pursue them.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Current at Apple only 20% of their employees are female, Google lags behind them with only 17%.</p>
						<p>It is believed this is caused by workplace sexism, a lack of female role models, stereotypes regarding womenâ€™s innate technical incompetency and the difficulties of combining tech careers with motherhood.</p>
						<p>So if we want to grow the industry, so need to get more girls to pursue Computer Science Degrees. We need to help girls in our community understand that there is so much oppertunity for them. </p>

						<h2>Benefits</h2>
						<p>This program will benefit the community as well as Modea.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Benefits for the community</h2>
						<p>The program not only introduces girls to the world of computer science, but we feel that it helps girls gain confidence in saying "Hey you can make a difference and you can have fun doing it."</p>
						<p>This also encourgages the community to see Modea as a source of education and caring individuals.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Benefits for Modea</h2>
						<p>Modea will be seen in a new light by the media by getting involved in a nationwide issue that helps our futures.</p>
						<p>This will also get us into schools and help us recruit more talent as these girls get into universities.</p>
						<p>The current Developers will be challenged as teaching helps you see problems in a new light. This will also challenge designers who want to learn to code by giving them the oppertunity to gain some training.</p>
						<p>We also feel that collaboration in this program will bleed into the work environment.</p>
